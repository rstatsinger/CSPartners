# The Contrast Partner Demo Environment (PDE)

The Contrast PDE is an Amazon Web Services (AWS) image (AMI) with a preconfigured environment for working with Contrast. We can allow you to copy it to your AWS account. This allows you to use the PDE on demand - to practice your demo, or to demo to customers and prospects - whenever you need it, and use it as much as you wish. It will help you demonstrate use cases such as:

## Contrast Assess:
1. Showing how Contrast helps developers discover and fix vulnerabilities from their IDEs, while they are writing code and checking functionality
2. Showing Slack integration – how Contrast immediately informs stakeholders of new discovered issues, for instant remediation
3. Showing Azure DevOps integration
4. Showing integration with Jenkins, and using Application Security as a quality gate whenever a build occurs
5. Showing Route Coverage, and how Contrast maps functional testing coverage into security testing coverage
6. Showing Flow Maps which help track connections and taint risk between applications or microservices

## Contrast OSS, showing how Contrast analyzes the risk of using open source software, including detailed class usage information and analysis of transitive library dependencies

## Contrast Protect:
1. Showing how Contrast detects and blocks attacks
2. Live Splunk integration – showing how Protect feeds attack forensics into Splunk
3. Showing how Contrast does all of this from a single unified platform

In addition, the PDE contains links to Contrast's open source Integrations repository on Github, so that you can show prospects the wide variety of available integrations.

## PDE Prerequisites
1. You must have an AWS account, and admin access to it. We will make a copy of the AMI into your account.
2. You must run the PDE in an AWS image type sufficient to power the environment. Contrast recommends that you run the environment in one of the following instance types to ensure sufficient compute resources and performance: m6g.xlarge, m5.xlarge, or m5a.xlarge. You are free to experiment with other image types if desired, however if you do not provide sufficient CPU/Memory/Disk/Network resources to the environment, the Contrast application will not start, and/or you will experience unacceptable performance.

For access and certification on the PDE, please contact your Contrast Security Channel Manager.
